### Hello World,

this is my first blog post in my new GatsbyJs blog.

In this blog i try to show how to work with modern frontend technologies like GatsbyJs and how to define building processes and find best practices for your next project.

Gatsby is a tool for creating static websites with React. It allows you to pull your data from virtually anywhere: CMS's (content management systems), Markdown files, JavaScript/ Typescript files, APIs and databases. Gatsby leverages GraphQL and node to combine your data and React code to generate static files for your blog or website.
